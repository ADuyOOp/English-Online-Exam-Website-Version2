          <h3><strong>1.3. TOEIC® Scoring and Assessment</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
          <p>The TOEIC® is not a pass-or-fail exam. It evaluates your English competence in Reading and Listening skills.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In the TOEIC® Reading and Listening test, candidates are marked based on the number of questions they answered correctly, which is then converted to a scaled score. The score report shows listening, reading and scaled score. The total scaled score is determined by adding two scaled scores together.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The TOEIC® Reading and Listening test gives a score between 10 and 990. Therefore, the maximum score for each section is 495.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Furthermore, security is also a reason why the TOEIC® test requires candidates to use pencils only.
